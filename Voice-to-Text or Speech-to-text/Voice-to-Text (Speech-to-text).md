**Introduction to Artificial Intelligence:**

Artificial Intelligence (AI), at times called as Machine Intelligence is defined as the study of intelligent agents where any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. The term &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is applied when a machine mimics &quot;cognitive&quot; functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;problem solving&quot;.

**Voice-to-Text or Speech-to-Text:**

Voice is the new interface driving ambient computing. Speech recognition is transforming our daily lives from digital assistants, dictation of emails and documents, to transcriptions of lectures and meetings.

Speech recognition is the inter-disciplinary sub-field of computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enables the recognition and translation of spoken language into text. It is also known as **automatic speech recognition (ASR)**, **computer speech recognition** or **speech to text (STT)**.

Several API&#39;s are available in the cloud by various tech giants such as Microsoft, Google, IBM, etc., that convert spoken audio to text. Call the API to recognize audio coming from the microphone, from other real-time streaming audio sources, or from a recorded audio file. You can use the API to build voice-triggered smart apps.
